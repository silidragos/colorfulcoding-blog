      <h2 className="text-3xl">XR Narrative Experiences and Exhibitions</h2>

      <p className='my-10'>
        The convergence of AR and VR technologies created in the last few years a whole new wave of opportunities for storytelling, documentaries, narrative experiences, and virtual art galleries across various platforms such as mobile devices, Oculus Quest, Apple VisionPro, and other 3D enhanced mediums. These technologies allow creators to craft immersive narratives that transcend traditional boundaries, placing audiences directly within the story or art piece.

      <h2 className="text-3xl">Digital Heritage</h2>

      <p>The opportunity of digital heritage lies in the ability to preserve and share cultural artifacts, monuments, and historical buildings through advanced technologies such as 3D scanning and recreation. Museums can digitally archive their collections, allowing for virtual exhibitions that transcend physical limitations and reach global audiences. Similarly, city monuments and historical buildings can be accurately scanned and recreated in 3D, preserving architectural heritage and enabling immersive experiences for virtual tourism and education. Interior spaces of significance, from ancient temples to modern landmarks, can also be documented and presented in interactive digital formats, providing insights into historical and cultural contexts. This fusion of digital technology with cultural preservation not only ensures the conservation of our collective heritage but also opens up new avenues for exploration and appreciation across diverse audiences. Some opportunities of Digital Heritage with 3D Scanning and such are:</p>
